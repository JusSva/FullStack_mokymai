One of his ancestors, also named George, was an Englishman who came from <a href="">Heavitree</a>, England, and settled in the <a href="">Connecticut Colony</a> in 1638.<sup><a href="">[11]</a></sup> Both of Gere's parents were <i><a href="">Mayflower</a></i> descendants; his ancestors include <a href="">Pilgrims</a> such as <a href="">John Billington</a>, <a href="">William Brewster</a>, <a href="">Francis Eaton</a>, <a href="">Francis Cooke</a>, <a href="">Degory Priest</a>, <a href="">George Soule</a> and <a href="">Richard Warren</a>. <sup><a href="">[12]</a></sup>

    <h2>Career</h2>

    <p>Gere first worked professionally at the <a href="">Seattle Repertory Theatre</a> and the <a href="">Provincetown Playhouse</a> on Cape Cod in 1969, where he starred in <i><a href="">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</a></i>. His first major acting role was in the 1971 rock opera <i><a href="">Soon</a></i>, written by Scott Fagan and Joe Kookoolis, which opened on Broadway at the Ritz Theatre and closed after three performances.<sup><a href="">[14]</a><a href="">[15]</a></sup> Following that, he appeared in the original London stage version of <i><a href="">Grease</a></i>, in 1973.<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup> Gere was one of the first notable Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring as a <a href="">gay Holocaust victim</a> in the 1979 <a href="">Broadway</a> production of <i><a href="">Bent</i></a>, for which he earned a <a href="">Theatre World Award</a>.
    <br><br>
    Gere began appearing in <a href="">Hollywood</a> films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in <a href=""><i>The Lords of Flatbush</i></a> (1974), he was replaced after fighting with his co-star <a href="">Sylvester Stallone</a>. Gere played a small but significant part in <a href=""><i>Looking for Mr. Goodbar</i></a> (1977) and starred in director <a href="">Terrence Malick</a>'s well-reviewed drama <a href=""><i>Days of Heaven</i></a> (1978).<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup> The crime drama <a href=""><i>American Gigolo</i></a> (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama <a href=""><i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i></a> (1982) (co-starring <a href="">Debra Winger</a>) cemented Gere's ascent to stardom, grossing almost $130 million<sup><a href="">[16]</a></sup> and winning two <a href="">Academy Awards</a> out of six nominations;<sup><a href="">[17]</a></sup> Gere himself received his first <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination. <sup><a href="">[18]</a></sup> For the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception. <sup><a href="">[19]</a><a href="">[20]</a></sup> His career rebounded with the releases of <a href=""><i>Internal Affairs</i></a> (1990) and <a href=""><i>Pretty Woman</i></a> (1990), the latter of which earned Gere his second <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination. <sup><a href="">[21]</a></sup> The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including <a href=""><i>Sommersby</i></a> (1993) (opposite <a href="">Jodie Foster</a>), <a href=""><i>Primal Fear</i></a> (1996) and <a href=""><i>Runaway Bride</i></a> (1999) (which reunited him with his Pretty Woman co-star <a href="">Julia Roberts</a>). <sup><a href="">[19]</a></sup> He also took a leading role in the action thriller <a href=""><i>The Jackal</i></a> (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role. <sup><a href="">[22]</a></sup>
    <br><br>
    Gere was named <a href=""><i>People</i></a> magazine's "<a href="">Sexiest Man Alive</a>" in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in the same year, he appeared in the hit films <a href=""><i>The Mothman Prophecies</i></a> (2002), <a href=""><i>Unfaithful</i></a> (2002), and the <a href="">Academy Award</a>-winning <a href="">musical film adaptation</a> <a href=""><i>Chicago</i></a> (2002),[7] for which Gere won his first <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a>. His <a href="">ballroom dancing</a> drama <a href=""><i>Shall We Dance?</i></a> (2004) was also a solid performer that grossed $170 million worldwide. <sup><a href="">[23]</a></sup> His next film, the <a href="">book-to-screen adaptation</a> <a href=""><i>Bee Season</i></a> (2005), was a commercial failure. <sup><a href="">[24]</a></sup> Gere went on to co-star with <a href="">Jesse Eisenberg</a> and <a href="">Terrence Howard</a> in <a href=""><i>The Hunting Party</i></a> (2007), a thriller in which he played a journalist in <a href="">Bosnia</a>. He next appeared with <a href="">Christian Bale</a>, <a href="">Heath Ledger</a> and <a href="">Cate Blanchett</a> in <a href="">Todd Haynes</a>' semi-biographical film about <a href="">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=""><i>I'm Not There</i></a> (2007); Gere was one of six actors to portray a variation of Dylan. He co-starred with <a href="">Diane Lane</a> in the romantic drama <a href=""><i>Nights in Rodanthe</i></a> (2008). The film was widely panned by critics <sup><a href="">[25]</a></sup> (making #74 on The Times Worst Films of 2008 list), <sup><a href="">[26]</a></sup> but grossed over $84 million worldwide. <sup><a href="">[27]</a></sup> The film is his most recent to have been produced entirely by a <a href="">major film studio</a>.
